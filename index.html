                    This game can be played with small to large groups as well as the entire camp. 
                    It is also a great game for "breaking the ice" on the first day/night of Camp.

                    <strong>Description:</strong>
                    Campers sit boys vs girls in bunk order on each side of the Lindendome leaving an aisle in the 
                    middle for campers to run down. There will be 2 boy judges for girls side and 2 girl judges for 
                    boys side sitting at the end of the aisle. At the start of each round, have 2 campers come up 
                    from the bunks that will participate in the round. Show them the dance move they will be doing 
                    for that round and tell them what they need to give for the answer (song title/artist, tv show or 
                    movie/character etc.) The song for that round is then played and they must work as a pair to 
                    perform the dance move down the aisle to the judges. Full points are given for being the first to 
                    reach the judges and give the correct answers or 1 point can be received for partial answers. In 
                    the middle of the activity there will be a dance off between boys and girls side. The whole of 
                    camp participates and points will be awarded for creativity, participation, and funky dance 
                    moves!
